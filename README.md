# The grand plan with this library
If you want a reference to Linear Algebra, I recommend reading this: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/
The plan is to first: 
* Create a vector class with functionality you'd expect... from a Vector. Basically get the arithmetic and stuff own
* Add other important functions like norm, distance, angle functions and std. deviation
* Add Matrice support, so a Matrices class with stuff like transformations etc.
* Look to adding fun stuff like Taylor Approximation, clustering, least squares etc.
